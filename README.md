# Mobile-Game-Analysis


ðŸŽ® FP20 Analytics Challenge 18 Submission ðŸŽ®

In this project, I explored data from 2008 to 2019 to answer key questions about the mobile gaming industry. By importing Excel data into SQL using Python and connecting it to Power BI, I was able to create a dynamic and insightful dashboard with the help of ZoomCharts.

Here are some of the insights I uncovered:

Top 5 Most Popular Games (2008-2019): Analyzed yearly trends to identify the most played games.

Highest Average Game Rating: Discovered the game developer with the highest average ratings.

Top 3 Highest-Earning Game Developers: Identified which developers made the most income from their App Store games.

Trends in Game Ratings and Prices: Observed how game ratings and prices evolved over the years.

Most Popular Language: Analyzed which language dominated the App Store games from 2008 to 2019.

Top 3 Games by User Rating Count (2016-2019): Highlighted the games that garnered the most user feedback.

Popular Game Genres: Identified the most popular game genres every 3 years.

Recommendations for New Developers:
Price: Suggested optimal pricing strategies.
Genre: Recommended the best genres to focus on.
Correlation Analysis: Explored the relationship between genre, game size, and price.
Additional Insights: Provided extra valuable findings from the dataset.
